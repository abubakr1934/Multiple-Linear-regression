# Multiple-Linear-regression
This repository contains a multiple linear regression model built using machine learning techniques to predict a company's expected profit at the end of the year based on various input features. The dataset used for training and testing this model consists of information about 50 companies, including their expenditures on research and development, marketing, administration, and the state in which they operate.

**Key Features:**
**Multiple Linear Regression:** The core of this project is a multiple linear regression algorithm, a fundamental tool in predictive analytics that takes into account multiple input variables to make accurate profit predictions.

**Dataset:** A comprehensive dataset of 50 companies with various attributes such as R&D expenditure, marketing spend, administrative costs, and location (state).

**Data Preprocessing:** Detailed data preprocessing steps are included to clean, normalize, and prepare the dataset for model training.

**Model Training:** The model has been trained on a portion of the dataset and tested on another portion to evaluate its predictive accuracy.

**Evaluation Metrics:** The repository includes metrics to assess the model's performance, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) values.

**Visualization:** Visualizations, such as scatter plots and regression plots, are provided to help interpret the model's performance and relationships between variables.

**Usage Guide:** A user-friendly guide on how to use the trained model for profit prediction is included in the repository.



Snapshots of the output:
the first column is the test set profit that is given and next to it is the predicted value by the model
